  # Optional: Proxy API requests to the backend
  # This is useful if you want to run frontend and backend on the same domain
  # but different paths (e.g., /api/treks).
  # For this simple setup, the React app directly calls the backend's full URL.
  # If you were to use this, you'd change the API_URL in App.js to '/api'
  # location /api/ {
  #   proxy_pass http://backend:5000/; # 'backend' is the service name in docker-compose
  #   proxy_set_header Host $host;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  # }
